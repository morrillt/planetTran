      <h4>Description of General System Functionality</h4>
      <p>phpScheduleIt was developed for reservation and resource management.
        This includes a full user log in and registration system, user profile
        management, the scheduling/reservation system, and numerous administration
        tools.</p>
      <p>The entire system was written using PHP  by Nick Korbel. The system
        uses any PEAR supported database to store and manage all user, resource
        and reservation information. Because of the availability of PHP, this
        system will run on any platform that meets the aforementioned necessary
        requirements.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the currently supported PEAR databases are: <em>dbase,
          fbsql, interbase, informix, msql, mssql, mysql, oci8, odbc, pgsql </em>and<em> sybase</em> (DB
          style interfaces to LDAP servers and MS ADO (using COM) are also availed
          from a separate package).</p>
      <p>The system is optimized for Internet Explorer 5.5 or greater, Netscape
        6.x or greater and Mozilla 1.0 or greater. Netscape 4.7 is <b>not</b> supported.</p>
      <p>Any questions or bug reports should be directed to Nick Korbel at <a href="mailto:lqqkout13@users.sourceforge.net">lqqkout13@users.sourceforge.net</a></p>
      <p>This project is in no way associated with <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> or
        <a href="http://www.pear.php.net">PEAR</a>. The PHP license is included
        in the lib/pear/ directory.</p>
      <h4>Requirements</h4>
      <p>- PHP 4.3 or higher (4.2.x is supported but not recommended)<br />
        - PEAR::DB (included with most versions of PHP)<br />
        - PEAR::DB supported database. Compatible databases can be <a href="http://www.pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-dsn.php">found
        here</a>. <a href="http://www.mysql.com"></a><br />
        - End-users need IE5+ or Netscape 6.x+ (Netscape 4.7 or earlier is NOT
        supported)</p>
      <h4>Installation/Setup</h4>
      <p>The installation creates all the necessary database tables and inserts
        a default schedule.</p>
      <p>Setup can be accomplished by using the included setup script (setup.php)
        or manually, by following the instructions below.</p>
      <p>Note: Many of these steps include syntax that may or may not be exclusive
        to MySQL. Please consult your database manual for other database syntaxes.</p>
      <p>1) Verify that the PEAR DB package, a PEAR supported database (<a href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=46" target="_blank">view
          currently supported databases</a>) and PHP version 4.2.0 or greater
          are installed and properly configured on the destination server. If
          not, download and install at least these versions.</p>
      <p>2) Copy all of the phpScheduleIt files provided into a desired web directory.
        Remember this directory because we will need it in the next two steps.</p>
      <p>3) Edit your config/config.php file to be sure it is correct for your
        web server set up. Most importantly, make sure that the 'weburi', 'dbType',
        'dbUser', 'dbPass' and 'dbName' settings are correct.</p>
      <h5><strong>Automatic setup -</strong></h5>
      <p>1) Simply run the install script by navigating your browser to http://yourwebsite.com/path_to_phpscheduleit/install/setup.php.
        You will be asked for your database password. Note that you do not need
        to log in as root, but the user needs to have permission to create and
        drop databases.</p>
      <p>2) You will receive a confirmation or rejection notice about each command
        being executed. If everything goes well, you will receive a final notice
        that the installation was successful.</p>
      <p>3) DELETE THE 'INSTALL' DIRECTORY. This is a critical step. If the directory
        is left, then anyone is open to destroy your newly created database.</p>
      <h5><strong>Manual setup -</strong></h5>
      <p>1) The initial database must now be set up. There is an included setup
        file for this. If you want to change the default user and password to
        be used for the schedule database, first edit the setup.sql file (please
        refer to your database's manual for more on how to accomplish this),
        then execute it. To execute the setup file in mysql, navigate to the
        MySQL executable directory (usually /usr/local/mysql/bin) and at the
        shell prompt type the following:</p>
      <p>mysql -u root -p &lt; <b>%path to directory%</b>/install/setup.sql</p>
      <p>For example: <i>mysql -u root -p &lt; /www/htdocs/phpscheduleit/install/setup.sql</i></p>
      <p>You will be prompted to enter the root MySQL password at this point.
        This script will create the schedule database, the schedule user/password
        combination and grant specific privileges to that user.</p>
      <p>For syntax for other databases, please consult your manual.</p>
      <p>2) Verify the installation was successful by bringing up the MySQL Monitor
        (typing <i><b>mysql</b></i> at the shell prompt). Please note that all
        commands entered in the MySQL Monitor end with a semicolon. At the mysql
        prompt, type <i><b>show databases;</b></i>. You will be informed that
        the database has been changed. </p>
      <p>If the database that you just created is listed, then the installation
        was successful.</p>
      <p>Type <b><i>quit;</i></b> to exit the MySQL Monitor.</p>
      <p>3) Open the config.php file and immediately change the administrative
        login (<span class="code">$conf['app']['adminEmail']</span>) from its
        default to a new desired login.</p>
      <p>4) If desired, change any other settings in the configuration file.</p>
      <p>5) You MUST RUN install/update/1.0.0_must_run.php from a web
        browser. This creates the default schedule and populates data.</p>
      <p>6) From
          the phpScheduleIt directory (<b>%path to directory%</b>), DELETE THE
          'INSTALL' DIRECTORY.</p>
      <h5><strong>Multiple Database Setup -</strong></h5>
      <p>To set up the system to use multiple databases (for example sharing
        a login table), first make sure that the tables that you want to use
        from a different database are already running. Next, set up a new version
        of phpScheduleIt by following either the Automatic or Manual Setup instructions
        above.</p>
      <p>Next, edit the config/config.php file. Find the 'pk_prefix' field and
        change it to something that no other instance of the scheduler is using.</p>
      <p>Now, you will need to edit the lib/DBEngine.class.php file. This is
        where all the database names to be used are defined. In the <span class="code">DBEngine()</span> function,
        find the line that starts with &quot;<span class="code">$this-&gt;dbs
        = array (xxxx);</span>&quot; For each additional database that you want
        to associate with this version phpScheduleIt, add a comma and then the
        name of the database, in single quotes. For example, to use 2 databases
        the line would look like this: </p>
      <p class="code">$this-&gt;dbs = array ($GLOBALS['conf']['db']['dbName'],
        'name_of_database2');</p>
      <p>Further down, find function <span class="code">define_tables()</span>.
        This is where the table/database relationships are defined. For each
        table, assign a database that it comes from. This can be done by counting,
        in order from 0, the number that the database you want to associate a
        table to, and typing that between the brackets on the same line as the
        table name. For example, to use the default database for the login table,
        but 'name_of_database2' for the rest of the tables, your code would look
        like this:</p>
      <pre class="code">$this-&gt;table_to_database = array (
   'login'	        =&gt; $this-&gt;dbs[0],
   'reservations'	=&gt; $this-&gt;dbs[1],
   'resources'    	=&gt; $this-&gt;dbs[1],
   'permission'		=&gt; $this-&gt;dbs[1]
 );</pre>
      <p>Be sure that you do not change the table names, only the number between
        the brackets.</p>
      <h4>Upgrading From version 0.9.3/0.9.9/1.0.0 beta</h4>
      <p>Note: A new configuration file is used in this release. Config files
        from earlier versions will not work. Please copy over any settings from
        the old config file to the new config file.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the release notes in the install directory for any additional
        information.</p>
      <p>* It is STRONGLY recommended that you upgrade to version 0.9.9 instead
        of going directly from 0.9.3 to 1.0.0. You can download version 0.9.9
        from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=95547&package_id=101920&release_id=237088">SourceForge</a>.</p>
      <h5><strong>Automatic Update -</strong></h5>
        <p><strong>From 0.9.3</strong> - If you want to upgrade from version
          0.9.3, please modify the two database variables at the top of install/update/0.9.3_to_0.9.9.php
        and
        then open
        that page in a browser. This file will update the database schema to
        the one that is used in this release and keep all of your data.</p>
        <p>* At the
            top of these files there are two variables; root_user and
            root_password. Please set these to a database root user who has permission
            to modify
          and delete databases.</p>
      <p><strong>From 0.9.9/1.0.0 beta</strong> - Please open /install/update/1.0.0_must_run.php
        in a text editor, modify the two database variables at the top ($root_user,
        $root_password), then run this file from a web browser and follow the
        instructions. This patches
        a bug
        in
        0.9.9.</p>
      <h5><strong>Manual Update-</strong></h5>
      <p><strong>From 0.9.3</strong> - To execute
        the setup file in MySQL, navigate to the MySQL executable directory (usually
        /usr/local/mysql/bin)
        and
        at
        the
      shell prompt type the following:</p>
      <p>mysql -u root -p &lt; <b>%path to directory%</b>/install/update/0.9.3_to_1.0.0.sql</p>
      <p>For example: <i>mysql -u root -p &lt; /www/htdocs/phpscheduleit/install/update/0.9.3_to_1.0.0.sql</i></p>
      <p>You will be prompted to enter the root MySQL password at this point.
        This script will update the  database to the current schema.</p>
      <p>For syntax for other databases, please consult your manual.</p>
      <p>You must also follow the directions in the next step.</p>      <p><strong>From 0.9.3/0.9.9</strong> -  Please open install/update/1.0.0_must_run.php
        in a text editor and set the top $manual variable
        to true. You need to run install/update/1.0.0_must_run.php from
        a web browser. This
        creates the default schedule and moves
        all current data to
        that schedule.</p>
      <p>It is strongly suggested that you also run 1.0.0_must_run.sql. This
        alters the database schema to add support for PostgreSQL and will be
      used in all future versions.</p>
      <h4>Getting Started</h4>
      <p>After the system has been successfully installed and set up, create
        an account for the administrator. You can do this by navigating to the
        Login (index.php) page and clicking the Register link. Be sure to enter
        the login exactly the same as it appears in the config.php file's 'adminEmail'
        setting.</p>
      <p>After the Administrator account has been registered, you need to add
        resources. Also, as new users are added, you will need to manage their
        permissions to allow them to reserve a resource.</p>
      <h4>Configuration File</h4>
      <h5>Application Settings</h5>
      <p>All of these settings apply to how the application functions.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['weburi']
      <p>This is the full URL to the base directory of phpScheduleIt (where index.php
        resides). For example, if you installed it in htdocs/phpscheduleit, the
        value would be http://www.yoursite.com/phpscheduleit.</p>
      <p>Please do not include the trailing slash on this value</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['adminEmail']</p>
      <p>This is the email address and login value for the administrator. phpScheduleIt
        allows for just one administrative account. Set this value to whatever
        you want to use as the administrative login and be sure to register an
        account with this value. You cannot log into phpScheduleIt using this
        address unless you register it.</p>
      <p>This email address will also be used as the 'from' address for all email
        contact with the users.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['defaultLanguage']</p>
      <p> The  language code for the default language. This must be included
        in the language list in langs.php and will be used as the default and
        if any translations fail for another language. This language file MUST
        be in the /lang directory.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['safeMode']</p>
      <p> If your web server is running PHP in safe mode. Set
        this value to 1 if PHP is running in safe mode or 0 if it is not.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['timeFormat']</p>
      <p>This is the format to view the times in. A value of 12 means that dates
        and times will be on the 12 hour clock (using am/pm). A value of 24 means
        that dates and times will be on the 24 hour clock (no am/pm).</p>
      <p>Only 12 and 24 are accepted values.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['calFirstDay'] = 0;</p>
	  <p>This is the first day of the week for the small navigational
        calendars. This must be a value between 0-6 (0 = Sunday, 6 = Saturday)</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['techEmail']</p>
      <p>The email address of your technical support. This value will be used
        to direct technical email and all bug reports. It is highly recommended
        to set this value so that this technical person can help the user or
        report any questions to the project homepage on SourceForge and improve
        phpScheduleIt.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['ccEmail']</p>
      <p>This value should contain all email address to CC when a user clicks
        the 'Email Admin' link. To specify multiple email addresses, separate
        them with commas.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['emailAdmin']</p>
      <p>This setting toggles whether to send email notifications of reservation
        and registration activity to administrator.</p>
      <p>The only values this can be are 0 (which means that email will not be
      sent) and 1 (which means that email will be sent).</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['emailType']</p>
      <p>This defines how email communications should be sent. In most cases,
        leaving the default value of 'mail' will work. The other options are
        'smtp' for SMTP, 'sendmail' for sendmail, or 'qmail' for qmail MTA.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['smtpHost']</p>
      <p>This defines the SMTP email host address. For example, smtp.email.com.
        You only need to set this variable if emailType is SMTP.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['smtpPort']</p>
      <p>This defines the SMTP port. This is only required if emailType
        is SMTP and the default value should be fine.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['sendmailPath']</p>
      <p>This defines the path to sendmail on your server. This only needs to
        be set if the emailType is 'sendmail' and the default value of '/usr/sbin/sendmail'
        will usually work.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['qmailPath']</p>
      <p> This defines the path to qmail. This only needs to be set if the emailType
        is 'qmail' and the default value of  '/var/qmail/bin/sendmail' will usually
        work.      </p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['defaultPassword']</p>
      <p>This value is the default password that is used when the administrator
        resets a password for a user. This value is only used if the admin does
        not enter a new password value when resetting a password for a user.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['title']</p>
      <p>This is the title to use for the application. It will be used as the
        default title for pages and as the 'From' field in all email contacts.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['use_perms']</p>
      <p>This setting toggles whether to use permissions or not. Using permissions
        will limit who can reserve resources. If permissions are on, only users
        who have been given permission to use a resource can reserve it. If permissions
        are turned off, anyone will be able to reserve any resource. Permission
        changes will still be saved, but they will not become effective until
        permissions are turned on through the config file.</p>
      <p>The only values this can be are 0 (which means that permissions will
        not be used) and 1 (which means that permissions will be used).</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['readOnlySummary']</p>
      <p>This value tells if the read only schedule (available
        to all users and guests) should show the reservation summaries.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['readOnlyDetails']</p>
      <p>This value tells if the read only schedule should allow
        visitors (registered and non-registered users) to click on the reservation
        and see the reservation details.</p>
      <p>Please note that this opens up a small security hole in that if this
        is set, the login is not required to view reservations and the details
        are viewable to potentionally anyone.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['use_log']</p>
      <p>This toggles the activity logging on or off. Logging writes all activity
        (registration, reservations, resource data) to a log file of your choice.</p>
      <p>The only values this can be are 0 (which means that logging will not
        be used) and 1 (which means that logging will be used).</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['app']['logfile']</p>
      <p>This value is the directory and file name of the log file to use. If
        the file does not exist, it will be created.</p>
      <p>Please specify this as /directory/filename.extension.</p>
      <h5>Database Settings</h5>
      <p>All of these settings determine the database setup.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['db']['dbType']</p>
      <p>This is the database backend type. This must be a valid PEAR::DB setting.</p>
      <p>The options are:<br />
        mysql -&gt; MySQL<br />
        pgsql -&gt; PostgreSQL<br />
        ibase -&gt; InterBase<br />
        msql -&gt; Mini SQL<br />
        mssql -&gt; Microsoft SQL Server<br />
        oci8 -&gt; Oracle 7/8/8i<br />
        odbc -&gt; ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)<br />
        sybase -&gt; SyBase<br />
        ifx -&gt; Informix<br />
        fbsql -&gt; FrontBase</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['db']['dbUser']</p>
      <p>This value is the database user who has permission to create, alter,
        modify and delete data from the tables phpScheduleIt uses. This value
        is required to access the tables.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['db']['dbPass']</p>
      <p>This value is the password for the database user specified in $conf['db']['dbUser'].
        This value is required to access the tables.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['db']['dbName']</p>
      <p>This is the name of the database to be used by phpScheduleIt for storing
        all system data. The user specified in $conf['db']['dbUser'] will be
        given permission to use all tables in this database.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['db']['hostSpec']</p>
      <p>This is the host setting for your database server. In most cases 'localhost'
        will work. Some servers require you to use the loopback address.</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['db']['drop_old']</p>
      <p>This value toggles whether the automatic installation should overwrite
        any databases with the same name as $conf['db']['dbName']. Please be
        very sure about this setting. If you are in doubt, leave it set to 0.</p>
      <p>The only values this can be are 0 (which means that an existing database
        with the same name will not be overwritten) and 1 (which means that the
        aforementioned database will be overwritten).</p>
      <p class="variable">$conf['db']['pk_prefix']</p>
      <p>This value is the prefix that will be prepended to all primary keys
        in this database. This is required if you will be sharing databases between
        multiple versions of phpScheduleIt (for example, sharing a login data
        but having a different resource data).</p>
      <p>This setting <strong>must be different</strong> for every instance of
        phpScheduleIt that is sharing the same database. 3 characters are recommended.
        Anything over 3 characters will be cut down to use only the first 3.</p>
      <h5>User Interface Settings</h5>
      <p>All of these settings change how the application looks and feels.</p>

      <h4>System Navigation</h4>
      <p>Entry into the phpScheduleIt system defaults to the login screen. Here
        a user can log in or navigate to the registration page. If a user has
        selected the &quot;Keep Me Logged In&quot; option, then they will be
        automatically forwarded to My Control Panel each time they return to
        the system (until they manually Log Out). After a successful login or
        registration, the user will be automatically forwarded to My Control
        Panel.</p>
      <p>My Control Panel is the &quot;Home Page&quot; for each user. They will
        be able to view, modify and delete their upcoming reservations. The list
        of reservations is sortable in ascending/descending order based on column
        name. Here, they will also be presented with a Quick Links table where
        they can navigate to the scheduler, edit their profile/password or log
        out of the system. Users can return to My Control Panel from anywhere
        in the system at any time by clicking the &quot;My Control Panel&quot; underneath
        the welcome message.</p>
      <p>The scheduler is where users book new reservations and edit past ones.
        Clicking on a resource's name will bring up a pop-up window where the
        user can reserve the resource. If the user selects a time which is already
        reserved by another user, the reservation will fail and they will be
        prompted to try again. Users CANNOT edit or delete another user's reservation.
        They will only be allowed to view it. Also, users cannot book or modify
        a reservation for a past date, an inactive resource or a resource that
        they have not been given permission to reserve. The administrator has
        the power to modify or delete any reservation in the system from both
        the scheduler and from the admin tool &quot;Manage Reservations&quot;.</p>
      <p>When a user clicks the Quick Link &quot;Edit My Profile Information/Password&quot;,
        they will be brought to a page resembling the Registration page with
        all of their information filled in (except the password). Editing the
        information will result in a change in the database. Blank or unchanged
        fields will not be altered in the database.</p>
      <h4>User Management</h4>
      <p><i>Warnings:</i></p>
      <p>When using more that one instance of phpScheduleIt are sharing a database,
        it is critical that all data integrity issues are addressed. For example,
        sharing a login table but using independent reservation/resource/training
        tables can result in compromised data integrity. If a user has reservations
        committed on more than one system and they are deleted from the global
        login table, their reservations will not be removed unless they are deleted
        from one of the secondary instances of the system.</p>
      <p>There are two main techniques that can be used to resolve this issue:</p>
      <p>1) The shared data (in this case, the login information) must be removed
        from a secondary instance of the application. This secondary instance
        will be aware of all databases in the system and will be able to remove
        all data associated with the data being deleted.</p>
      <p>2) The &quot;leftover&quot; data can be manually deleted from the system
        by an Administrator. In this example, reservations associated with deleted
        users can be deleted from the scheduler or from the admin tools.</p>
      <p><i>Notes:</i></p>
      <p>The initial <i>login</i> table will be empty.</p>
      <p>All users are required to register upon first use of phpScheduleIt.
        All fields in the Registration form are required. Registration will fail
        if the form is not completed entirely. Upon successful registration,
        a unique memberid will be automatically created for each user.</p>
      <p>Users can edit their personal information at any time by logging in
        and selecting the &quot;Edit My Profile Information/Password&quot; option
        in the Quick Links table. They will be taken to their personal information
        page where any of the fields can be changed.</p>
      <p><i>Administrative Tool : Manage Users</i></p>
      <p>The administrator can delete users at any time from the system by selecting
        the &quot;Manage Users&quot; option in the Quick Links table. The &quot;Manage
        Users&quot; tool will navigate to a page listing all users, sorted alphabetically
        (by default), showing a specific number of users at a time. The list
        of users can be sorted by ascending/descending order by column name.
        For each column, clicking on the minus sign sorts the list in descending
        order based on that column name, clicking on the plus sign sorts the
        list in ascending order based on that column name. The sorting order
        will be preserved throughout pages.</p>
      <p>From this table, you can email a user by clicking their email address,
        view all information about this user by clicking the View Info link,
        manage that user's training by clicking the Training link, or delete
        any number of users by checking their delete box.</p>
      <p>Clicking a users name link for a user will bring up a new window listing
        all information about the selected user.</p>
      <p>Clicking the Reset password link will bring you to a screen that allows
        you to reset a password for a user. This should rarely have to be done,
        because users have the power to get a new password if one is forgotten.
        This function resets the users password to the specified value or to
        the default value set in the config file if no value is given on the
        reset form. No confirmation email will be sent, so please notify the
        user after resetting their password.</p>
      <p>Clicking the Permissions link will navigate to a new window where you
        can select which resources a user has or has not been given permission
        to use. Upon registration,
        will only have permission to use resources if auto-assign has been turned
        on in the config file. To grant or revoke permission for a user, check
        or uncheck the checkbox for
        each
        resource
        the
        user is
        allowed to use.</p>
      <p> To delete a user, simply check the &quot;Delete User&quot; box for
        each user who the administrator wishes to remove and press the &quot;Delete
        Users&quot; button. The administrator will be prompted to verify the
        removal of all selected users and all of their reservations. After the
        successful removal of users, the Manage Users page will be refreshed
        showing that the changes have been made.<b> Deleting a user will also
        delete ALL reservations for that user.</b></p>
      <h4>Resource Management</h4>
      <p><i>Notes:</i></p>
      <p>The initial <i>resources</i> table will be empty.</p>
      <p><i>Administrative Tool : Manage Resources</i></p>
      <p>The administrator can delete resources at any time from the system by
        selecting the &quot;Manage Resources&quot; option in the Quick Links
        table. The &quot;Manage Resources&quot; tool will navigate to a page
        listing all resources, sorted alphabetically (by default), showing a
        specific number of resources at a time. The list of resources can be
        sorted by ascending/descending order by column name. For each column,
        clicking on the minus sign sorts the list in descending order based on
        that column name, clicking on the plus sign sorts the list in ascending
        order based on that column name. The sorting order will be preserved
        throughout pages.</p>
      <p>To add a resource, enter the resource data into the Add Resource table
        at the bottom of the Manage Resources page. </p>
      <p>You
          will need to specify which schedule this resource belongs to. You will
          also need to set the minimum and maximum reservation lengths. Users
          will not be able to make reservations that are shorter than the minimum
          or longer than the maximum. Checking the Auto-Assign Permission checkbox
        tells phpScheduleIt that you want all users (current and future) to be
        given permission to use this resource.</p>
      <p>Press the &quot;Add Resource&quot; button. The resource will be added
        into the database with a unique identification number and
        the
        Manage
        Resources
        page will
        be
        refreshed,
        showing the new
        resource. New resources will be set to &quot;Active&quot; by default.</p>
      <p>To modify a resource's information, click on the resource's Edit link.
        The information will appear in the form below. Any field that is changed
        will be updated in the database. Unchanged or empty fields will not be
        changed in the database.</p>
      <p>To delete a resource, check the Delete checkbox for each resource the
        administrator wishes to delete and press the &quot;Delete Resources&quot; button.
        The administrator will be prompted to verify the removal of the selected
        resources. <b>Deleting a resource will also delete ALL reservations held
        for that resource.</b> After the resources have been removed from the
        database, the Manage Resources page will be refreshed, showing the successful
        removal of the resources.</p>
      <p>The status column lists each resource's <i>current</i> status. To change
        a resource's status, simply click on the link in the &quot;Status&quot; column
        and the resource will either be activated or inactivated. Resource status
        does NOT affect previously made reservations.</p>
      <p>When adding or modifying a resource, you have the option to select the
        minimum and maximum reservation length. Reservations less than the minimum
        or greater than the maximum length specified will not be accepted. Setting
        these values to the same time will require that all reservations are
        of this length.</p>
      <h4>Other Admin Tools</h4>
      <p>The administrator's Quick Links table is different than all others.        <i>Manage
        Users</i> and <i>Manage Resources</i> have been described already. The
        rest will be described now. As a note, the admin tools can only be accessed
        by a user who logs in as the administrator. All other users will be locked
        out of any administrative page.</p>
      <p><em>Manage Schedules</em> allows you to add or edit schedules. Below
        is a description of the schedule properties:<br />
      Schedule Title: Title of the schedule to appear in links and as a title<br />
      Day Start: Time of the day to begin allowing reservations<br />
      Day End: Time of the day to stop allowing reservations<br />
      Time Span: Reservation intervals<br />
      Week Day Start: Day of the week to start the schedule<br />
      Days To Show: Number of days to show on the schedule at a time<br />
      Reservation Offset: Number of days in advance a user needs to make a reservation<br />
      Hidden: Whether the schedule can be viewed<br />
      Show Summary: Whether to show the reservation summaries<br />
      Admin Email: Email address of the administrator of this schedule</p>
      <p><i>Manage Reservations</i> will navigate to a page listing all reservations
        in the database ordered by increasing date, showing a specific number
        of reservations per page. The list of reservations can be sorted by ascending/descending
        order by column name. For each column, clicking on the minus sign sorts
        the list in descending order based on that column name, clicking on the
        plus sign sorts the list in ascending order based on that column name.
        The sorting order will be preserved throughout pages.</p>
      <p>In this table, clicking on the user's name will open a pop-up window
        with all of the selected user's information. Clicking on the view, modify,
        delete links will open a pop-up window allowing you to view, modify or
        delete the selected reservation.</p>
      <p><em>Manage Blackout Times</em> brings you to a page set up like the
        online scheduler, but allows you to set blackout times (times that are
        unavailable to reserve). Setting blackout times is just like making a
        reservation.</p>      
      <p><i>        Search Scheduled Resource Usage</i> will navigate to a search
        form which will allow the administrator to specify certain search criteria.
          The criteria is as follows: all or any specific user, all or any specific
          resource, all or any specific PI, starting and ending times and starting
          and ending dates. By default, the selected starting and ending times
          will be the same as what is provided in the configuration file and
          the selected starting and ending dates are the lowest and highest dates
          currently
          reserved.</p>
      <p>After performing the search, the results will be printed out for each
        user/resource combination, listed alphabetically. These results are also
        available in a text-only format by clicking the &quot;Print these results
        to a text file&quot; link at the top of the results page.</p>
      <p><em>Mass Email Users</em> will navigate to a page where you can send
        a mass email to any or all of the registered users. This email can contain
        HTML tags, if you wish.</p>
      <p><em>View System Stats</em> will bring you to a page where many statistics
        about almost every aspect of the system are given. Reservation statistics
        are also graphed out.</p>
      <h4>Configuring Announcements</h4>
      <p>An unlimited number of announcements can be added to the system. They
        are added in the config.php file. To add an announcement, simply set
        the value of $conf['ui']['announcement'][] to some value enclosed within
        quotes. Example: <span class="code">$conf['ui']['announcement'][] = &quot;This
        is an announcement.&quot;;</span></p>
      <p>To add more announcements, just add more announcement variables. For
        example, <span class="code">$conf['ui']['announcement'][] = &quot;Another
        Announcement&quot;;</span></p>
      <p>The last announcement added will show up first, and the others will
        be displayed going from last added to first.</p>
      <p>If you do not want any announcements, simply delete all announcements
        except the first one, but place &quot;<span class="code">//</span>&quot; in
        front of it.</p>
      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p>All database manipulation should be done though the Administration Tools,
        NOT manually. <i>Manually editing the database can lead to data corruption
        and render the system unstable or useless.</i></p>
