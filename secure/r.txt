<li>Fares include tolls and airport fees, but not bridge tolls.</li>
<li>There are NEVER any fuel surcharges with PlanetTran.</li>
<li>Tips are not included in flat rates and tipping is not expected. We are committed to
fair wages for all employees. Our drivers are compensated by hourly time, not based
on number of trips or tips. We feel that this results in the most convenient customer
experience. However, drivers may accept small cash tips as a token of appreciation
for superior service. That said, drivers should never solicit tips and you should not feel obligated to tip. We expect excellence as part of our job. Please be aware that we cannot provide a receipt for cash tips, nor can we add a tip to a credit card or invoiced transaction.</li>
