		<p>On New Year's Day, 2003, while reading a book about environmental entrepreneurship, I wondered why hired vehicles such as taxis and limousines still were based on traditional platforms: Crown Victoria, Lincoln Town Car, mini-vans, etc. The only innovation of late has been to make the platforms larger by switching to SUVs. Why are livery fleets, the largest class of public vehicles on city streets, comprised mostly of large, inefficient, gas-guzzling beasts?</p>
		<p>With that question, PlanetTran was born. The vision: an urban transportation infrastructure that utilizes the most efficient transportation technology available. The mission: start a livery service based exclusively on the hybrid electric/gas Toyota Prius, the most technologically advanced vehicle on the road.</p>
		<p>I hope you share this vision of smarter urban transportation services, and will make a reservation with PlanetTran today!</p>
