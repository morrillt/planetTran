              <p>PlanetTran's all Toyota, all-hybrid fleet includes:</p>

              <h2>Prius Hybrid</h2>
              <p>The Prius can seat four people in addition to the driver, which is comfortable for shorter trips. Typically, three adults with bags for a week is a very efficient arrangement. The Prius can carry skis, golf clubs, etc. by folding down one half of the back seat, but this reduces the person capacity to two.</p>

              <h2>Prius V Hybrid</h2>
              <p>The Prius V is the newest addition to our fleet. Relative to the standard Prius, the Prius V is an inch wider, 6 inches longer and 3 inches taller. Its wheelbase is 3 inches greater, and there's 60% more cargo room in the back. The V (stands for "Versatility") is a great solution for the family of four going to the airport with two car seats and luggage for a week.</p>

              <h2>Camry Hybrid</h2>
              <p>The Camry can also seat four people in addition to the driver, which is comfortable for shorter trips. The Camry is great if you are looking for a more traditional sedan; you can typically fit luggage for two adults for a week in the trunk.</p>

              <h2>Highlander Hybrid</h2>
              <p>The Highlander is our largest vehicle, and seats four people comfortably in addition to the driver. The Highlander is great for longer trips, or if you have a lot of luggage. It does require a step up, so may not be ideal for those with limited mobility.</p>

	      <h2>Lexus Sedan (Massachusetts only)</h2>
              <p>For those seeking a more luxurious sedan experience, choose the Lexus HS250. With interior room for three, the trunk will hold luggage for three for a long weekend.</p>
