              <p>PlanetTran tracks all commercial flights and wait time is not charged for any passenger arriving on a commercial airline, as long as we have accurate flight information in your reservation. We can&rsquo;t ensure on-time pickup if we do not have correct flight information in the reservation. You do not need to call us to tell us your flight is delayed; we will see that on our tracker and automatically accommodate your new arrival time. However, if you have changed flights, you need to let us know your new flight information by calling us at +1.888.756.8876 or +1.617.944.9229. For arriving flights we will wait as long as it takes (baggage claim can be a nightmare, we know!) as long as we hear from you. If we can't make contact and we don't hear from you, we will leave an hour after the flight lands.</p>
