              <h2>Cancellation</h2>
              <p>Cancellation of reservations within one hour of scheduled pick-up will result in a charge of the full fare (minimum 1.5 hours for hourly trips). A no-show fee for the full fare will be charged when the passenger fails to arrive at the pickup location, without contact, within one hour of the reservation time.  To avoid a no show fee, please call 888-756-8876 and select option 1 if you cannot locate your PlanetTran vehicle.</p>
              <h2>Wait time</h2>
              <p>PlanetTran bills wait time after a 10-minute grace period at a flat $60 an hour, in increments of 10 minutes.</p>
              <h2>Payments</h2>
              <p>Payment can be made using VISA, MC, or AMEX, which can be entered in your on-line profile (we do not accept cash). After you have disembarked the vehicle, the credit card will be charged the appropriate fare (tolls and airport fees included), and we will email you a receipt (we strive for paperless operations).</p>
              <h2>Tipping</h2>
              <p>Tips are neither included nor expected for our services. We are committed to fair wages for all our employees. Our driver compensation model is based on hourly time, not the trip, which results in the most convenient and streamlined experience for our customers. We expect our drivers, as well as other employees, to deliver excellence as part of their job. Please be aware that we cannot provide a receipt for cash tips, nor can we add a tip to a credit card or invoiced transaction.</p>
