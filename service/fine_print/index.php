	      <h2>Cancellation</h2>
	      <p>Cancellation of reservations within one hour of a scheduled pickup will result in a charge of the full fare (minimum 1.5 hours for hourly trips). A no-show fee for the full fare will be charged when the passenger fails to arrive at the pickup location, without contact, within 45 minutes of the reservation time. To avoid a no-show fee, please call 1.888.756.8876 and select option 1 if you cannot locate your PlanetTran vehicle.</p>

	      <h2>Wait time</h2>
	      <p>PlanetTran bills wait time after a 10-minute grace period at a flat $65 an hour, in increments of 10 minutes.</p>

	      <h2>Payments</h2>
	      <p> Payment can be made using VISA, MC, Discover or AMEX, which can be entered in your online account, or through a corporate direct bill. We do not accept cash, and drivers cannot accept payment for trips. We will charge your credit card the night after the trip is completed, and will then email your itemized receipt. PlanetTran is PCI compliant and does not store your credit card number in our system.</p>

	      <h2>Airport</h2>
	      <p>Fees Although PlanetTran does not charge any tolls or fuel surcharges, we do add the fees that we are charged by airports to drop off our pick up. The airport fees are as follows: Boston Logan International: $3.25 (pickup only) Providence T.F. Green: $6.00 (pickup only) Manchester Airport: $4.00 (pickup only) San Francisco International: $3.65 for dropoff, $9.65 for pickup San Jose Airport: $1 for dropoff, $4.00 for pickup Oakland Airport: $4.00 (pickup only)</p>

	      <h2>Tipping</h2>
	      <p>Tips are neither included nor expected for our services. We are committed to fair wages for all our employees. Our driver compensation model is based on hourly time, not the trip, which we feel results in the most convenient and streamlined experience for our customers. We expect our drivers, as well as other employees, to deliver excellence as part of their job. Please be aware that we cannot provide a receipt for cash tips, nor can we add a tip to a credit card or invoiced transaction.</p>

	      <h2>Corporate Discounts</h2>
	      <p>PlanetTran offers discounts to organizations or groups that exceed $10,000 in annual fares. To discuss setting up a corporate account, please email us at customerservice@planettran.com, or call us at 1.888.756.8876.</p>
